Consider an array consisting of –ve and +ve numbers. What would be the worst case time complexity of an algorithm to segregate the numbers having same sign altogether i.e all +ve on one side and then all -ve on the other ?
A
O(N)
B
O(N Log N)
C
O(N * N)
D
O(N Log Log N)
Answer:---A
Explanation

Here we can use the partition algorithm of quick sort for segregation and answer will be O(N).
Choose the first element as pivot whatever may be its sign we don’t care and keep an extra index at pivot position .
