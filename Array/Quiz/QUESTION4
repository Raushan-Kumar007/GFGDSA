Let A be a square matrix of size n x n. Consider the following program. What is the expected output?

 



C = 100

for i = 1 to n do

    for j = 1 to n do

    {

        Temp = A[i][j] + C

        A[i][j] = A[j][i]

        A[j][i] = Temp - C

    } 

for i = 1 to n do

    for j = 1 to n do

        Output(A[i][j]);

A
The matrix A itself
B
Transpose of matrix A
C
Adding 100 to the upper diagonal elements and subtracting 100 from diagonal elements of A
D
None of the above
Answer:---A
Explanation
If we take look at the inner statements of first loops, we can notice that the statements swap A[i][j] and A[j][i] for all i and j. Since the loop runs for all elements, every element A[l][m] would be swapped twice, once for i = l and j = m and then for i = m and j = l. Swapping twice means the matrix doesnâ€™t change.
