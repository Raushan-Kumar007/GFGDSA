Let A[1...n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. What is the expected number of inversions in any permutation on n elements ?
A
n(n-1)/2
B
n(n-1)/4
C
n(n+1)/4
D
2n[logn]
Answer:---B
Explanation

There are n(n-1)/2 pairs such that i < j. For a pair (ai, aj), probability of being inversion is 1/2. Therefore expected value of inversions = 1/2 * (n(n-1)/2) = n(n-1)/4.
