The minimum number of comparisons required to determine if an integer appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers is

A

Θ(n)

B

Θ(logn)

C

Θ(log*n)

D

Θ(1)

Answer:---D
Explanation

If you answered Theta(1), then think of examples {1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4}, {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3} The Best way to find out whether an integer appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array(Ascending Order) of n integers, would be binary search approach.

The First occurrence of an element can be found out in O(log(n)) time using divide and conquer technique,lets say it is i.
The Last occurrence of an element can be found out in O(log(n)) time using divide and conquer technique,lets say it is j.
Now number of occuerrence of that element(count) is (j-i+1). Overall time complexity = log n +log n +1 = O(logn)
