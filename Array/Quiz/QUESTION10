Consider a two dimensional array A[20][10]. Assume 4 words per memory cell, the base address of array A is 100, elements are stored in row-major order and first element is A[0][0]. What is the address of A[11][5] ?
A
560
B
460
C
570
D
575
Answer:---A
Explanation
Element A[11][0] is stored at "Base Address + 11 * 10 * 4" which is "Base Address + 440" = 540. So A[11][5] is stored at 540 + 5*4 = 560.
