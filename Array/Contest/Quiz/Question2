An all-pairs shortest-paths problem is efficiently solved using:

A
Dijkstra' algorithm
B
Bellman-Ford algorithm
C
Kruskal algorithm
D
Floyd-Warshall algorithm
Answer:---D
EXPLANATION

An all-pairs shortest-paths problem is efficiently solved using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
For more information on all-pairs shortest-paths problem and its solution using Floyd-Warshall algorithm Refer:Dynamic Programming | Set 16 (Floyd Warshall Algorithm)
So, option (D) is correct.
