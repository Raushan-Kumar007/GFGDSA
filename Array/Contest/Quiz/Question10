The function f is defined as follows:
 
int f (int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    else if (n % 2  ==  0) return f(n/2);
    else return f(3n - 1);
}
Assuming that arbitrarily large integers can be passed as a parameter to the function, consider the following statements.

1. The function f terminates for finitely many different values of n ≥ 1.

ii. The function f terminates for infinitely many different values of n ≥ 1.

iii. The function f does not terminate for finitely many different values of n ≥ 1.

iv. The function f does not terminate for infinitely many different values of n ≥ 1.

Which one of the following options is true of the above?


(i) and (iii)
(i) and (iv)
(ii) and (iii)
(ii) and (iv)
Answer:---D
EXPLANATION

The function terminates for all values having a factor of 2 {(2.x)2==0}

So, (i) is false and (ii) is TRUE.

Let n = 3, it will terminate in 2nd iteration.

Let n=5, it will go like 5 - 14 - 7 - 20 - 10 - 5 – and now it will repeat.

And any number with a factor of 5 and 2, there are infinite recursions possible.

So, (iv) is TRUE and (iii) is false.
