What will be the output of the following JAVA program? 



C/C++ Code
 class GFG
{
   static int d=1;
   static void count(int n)
    {
    System.out.print(n+" ");
    System.out.print(d+" ");
    d++;
    if(n > 1) count(n-1);
    System.out.print(d+" ");
  }

 public static void main(String args[])
    {
       count(3);
    }
}




3 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 4

3 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2

3 1 2 2 1 3 4

3 1 2 1 1 1 2

Answer:---A
EXPLANATION

count(3) will print value of n and d. So 3 1 will be printed 
and d will become 2. 

Then count(2) will be called. It will print value of n and d. 
So 2 2 will be printed and d will become 3. 

Then count(1) will be called. It will print value of n and d.
So 1 3 will be printed and d will become 4. 

Now count(1) will print value of d which is 4. count(1) will 
finish its execution. 

Then count(2) will print value of d which is 4. 

Similarly, count(3) will print value of d which is 4. 
So series will be A.
