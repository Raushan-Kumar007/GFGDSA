Consider the JAVA function given below. 



C/C++ Code
  static  int f(int j)
{
   int i = 50;
  int k;
  if (i == j)
  {
    System.out.print("something");
    k = f(i);
    return 0;
  }
  else return 0;
}

Which one of the following is TRUE?






The function returns 0 for all values of j.

The function prints the string something for all values of j.

The function returns 0 when j = 50.

The function will exhaust the runtime stack or run into an infinite loop when j = 50

Answer:---D
EXPLANATION


When j is 50, the function would call itself again and again as neither i nor j is changed inside the recursion.
