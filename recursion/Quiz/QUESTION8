Consider the following recursive C function that takes two arguments

 

 unsigned int foo(unsigned int n, unsigned int r) {

  if (n  > 0) return (n%r +  foo (n/r, r ));

  else return 0;

}


What is the return value of the function foo when it is called as foo(345, 10) ?
A
345
B
12
C
5
D
3
Explanation
The call foo(345, 10) returns sum of decimal digits (because r is 10) in the number n. Sum of digits for 345 is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
