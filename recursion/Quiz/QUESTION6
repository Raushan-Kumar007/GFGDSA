What does the following function do?

 

int fun(unsigned int n)

{

    if (n == 0 || n == 1)

        return n;



    if (n%3 != 0)

        return 0;



    return fun(n/3);

}

A
It returns 1 when n is a multiple of 3, otherwise returns 0
B
It returns 1 when n is a power of 3, otherwise returns 0
C
It returns 0 when n is a multiple of 3, otherwise returns 1
D
It returns 0 when n is a power of 3, otherwise returns 1
Explanation
Lets solve with example, n = 27 which power of 3.
First time if condition is false as n is neither equal to 0 nor equal to 1 then 27%3 = 0.
Here, again if condition false because it is equal to 0.
Then fun(27/3) will call.

Second time if condition is false as n is neither equal to 0 nor equal to 1 then 9%3 = 0.
Here again if condition false because it is equal to 0.

Then fun (9/3) will call and third time if condition is false as n is neither equal to 0 nor equal to 1 then 3%3 = 0.
Here again if condition false because it is equal to 0.

Then fun(3/3) will call here n==1 if condition gets true and it return n i.e. 1.

Option (B) is correct.
