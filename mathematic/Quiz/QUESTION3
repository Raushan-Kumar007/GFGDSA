In an experiment, one red dice and one black dice(both are fair) are rolled. What is the probability that,

The number on black dice will divide the number on red dice.
Number on black dice is multiple of the number on red dice.
A

22 / 36 and 14 / 36 respectively

B

12 / 36 and 18 / 36 respectively

C

14 / 36 and 14 /36 respectively

D

6 / 36 and 8 / 36 respectively

Answer:----C

Explanation

We have two dice one is black and the other one is red: There will be a total of 36 outcomes.

We have to find the probability of the outcome that the number on black dice divides the number on red dice.
1 divides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
2 divides 2, 4, 6.
3 divides 3, 6.
4 divides 4.
5 divides 5.
6 divides 6.
There are 14 numbers that will be counted as favorable outcomes.
Therefore, probability = favorable outcome / total outcome.
i.e. = 14 / 36.

We have to find the probability that the number on black dice is multiple of number on red dice.
1 is multiple of 1
2 is multiple of 1 and 2.
3 is multiple of 1 and 3.
4 is multiple of 1, 2 and 4
5 is multiple of 1 and 5.
6 is multiple of 1, 2, 3 and 6.
There are 14 number which will be counted in favourable outcome;
probability = favorable outcome / total outcome.
i.e. = 14 / 36.
