There are n terms in an A.P. where n is even. The sum of odd terms and even terms are 63 and 72 respectively. The last term is greater than first term by 16.5 , Calculate n.

A
10
B
12
C
14
D
16

Answer:----b

Explanation
(Number of terms / 2) * Common difference = (Sum of even terms - Sum of odd terms )

(n/2) * d = 72 - 63
nd= 18

d= common difference

Last term - first term = 16.5
(n-1)d = 16.5
nd - d = 16.5
d = 1.5
n = 12
