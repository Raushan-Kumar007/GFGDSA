What will be the remainder when 7100 is divided by 5?
A
0
B
1
C
2
D
3

Answer:---B
Explanation
This is a basic question of Chinese remainder theorem(CRT):

We can write 7100 as (74)25.

Now, 74 = 2401 when we divide it by 5 then 1 will be the remainder.

Now, 7100 as (74)25 = (2401)25 mod 5 = 125 mod 5 = 1.

Therefore, (7100 % 5) = 1.
