There are three numbers a, b, c in G.P. such that a + b + c = 14. If a and b are increased by 1 and c is decreased by 1 then the series formed by these numbers is in A.P. Calculate the value for a*b*c ?

A
64
B
105
C
128
D
150

Answer:----A

Explanation
Given, a + b + c = 14

a' = a +1
b' = b +1
c' = c -1

a' + b' + c' = 15
2b' = a' + c'

15 - b' = 2b'
b' = 5
b = 4
a' + b' =10
By hit and trial,

a' = 3, b' = 5, c' = 7 and,
a = 2, b = 4, c = 8
